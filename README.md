# Project 11 OCR (Vadim333)

This project is a **reservation platform for strength competitions** organized by the company **GÃ¼dlft**.

The goal is to **fix bugs and errors** in the existing project, [Python_Testing](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Python_Testing), and to **add new features**. Each fix or feature is implemented in a dedicated branch and accompanied by tests using **Pytest** and **Locust**.
